# The Case of the Disappearing Commit

Detective Clara Jenkins was known in her precinct as "The Code Whisperer." Before joining the force, Clara had been a software developer, writing code for complex systems. Her unique blend of technical prowess and detective instincts made her the go-to investigator for any case with a technological edge.

One morning, Clara was called to the scene of a murder at a tech startup called CodeCove, a rising star in the AI world. The victim was Arthur Greaves, the company’s lead developer, found lifeless in the conference room. The death was clearly suspicious, and the evidence was sparse. A coffee cup smeared with fingerprints sat on the table, but it yielded no DNA matches. The only other clue? Arthur’s laptop, still open to a terminal window displaying Git logs.
